### Two Sum
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

#### Constraints:
- $2 \leq nums.length \leq 10^4$
- $-10^9 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^9$
- $-10^9 \leq target \leq 10^9$

#### Solution
